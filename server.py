Facebook Ads MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Facebook Marketing API that provides
entity management and performance reporting capabilities with automatic pagination.

Transport Method:
    This server uses stdio (standard input/output) transport, which is the standard
    method for MCP servers. The server communicates with clients (like Claude Desktop)
    through stdin/stdout, making it compatible with any MCP-compliant client.

    Use it to find the account_id needed for all other tools.

    Returns:
        List of ad account dictionaries with keys:
        - id: Account ID with 'act_' prefix (e.g., "act_123456789")

    Get performance insights for a Facebook ad account.

    Automatically fetches all pages of insights data and returns complete results.
    This is the primary tool for retrieving performance metrics.
    
    **WORKFLOW FOR FILTERING BY CAMPAIGN NAME:**
    If user wants data for campaigns matching a pattern (e.g., "CH | FR" campaigns):
    1. First call list_campaigns(account_id) to get all campaigns with their IDs
    2. Filter the results to find campaigns whose names match the pattern
    3. Extract the campaign IDs from matching campaigns
    4. Call get_account_insights with campaign_ids parameter set to those IDs
    
    **CALCULATING CTR AND CPC:**
    The API returns ctr and cpc based on link clicks, which may differ from UI.
    To match Facebook UI exactly, calculate manually:
    - CTR = (inline_link_clicks / impressions) * 100
    - CPC = spend / inline_link_clicks

    Args:
        account_id: Ad account ID (with or without 'act_' prefix)
            Example: "act_123456789" or just "123456789"
        start_date: Start date in YYYY-MM-DD format
            Example: "2025-01-01"
        end_date: End date in YYYY-MM-DD format
            Example: "2025-01-31"
        fields: List of metrics to retrieve. ALWAYS include the fields you need!
            
            **BASIC METRICS (most common):**
            - 'spend': Total cost/spend
            - 'impressions': Number of times ads were shown
            - 'reach': Unique people who saw ads
            - 'inline_link_clicks': Link clicks (use this for CTR/CPC calculations)
            - 'clicks': All clicks (includes likes, comments, shares)
            
            **CALCULATED METRICS (returned by API but may differ from UI):**
            - 'ctr': Click-through rate
            - 'cpc': Cost per click
            - 'cpm': Cost per 1000 impressions
            
            **CAMPAIGN/ADSET/AD INFO (include when level != 'account'):**
            - 'campaign_name', 'campaign_id': Campaign details
            - 'adset_name', 'adset_id': Ad set details
            - 'ad_name', 'ad_id': Ad details
            
            **CONVERSION METRICS:**
            - 'actions': Standard pixel events (purchases, leads, etc.)
              Returns flattened as: action_purchase, action_lead, etc.
            - 'action_values': Monetary values of actions
              Returns flattened as: action_value_purchase, etc.
            - 'conversions': Facebook Conversions API events
              Returns: conversion_schedule_total (appointments), 
                       conversion_find_location_total, etc.
            - 'purchase_roas': Return on ad spend for purchases
            
        level: Aggregation level - MUST match what you're querying:
            - 'account': Total account performance (no breakdown)
            - 'campaign': Broken down by campaign (include campaign_name in fields)
            - 'adset': Broken down by ad set (include adset_name in fields)
            - 'ad': Broken down by individual ad (include ad_name in fields)
            
        breakdowns: Optional list for demographic/platform segmentation:
            - ['age']: By age group
            - ['gender']: By gender
            - ['age', 'gender']: By age AND gender
            - ['country']: By country
            - ['publisher_platform']: By platform (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
            
        time_increment: Time granularity for the data:
            - '1': Daily breakdown (one row per day)
            - '7': Weekly breakdown
            - 'monthly': Monthly breakdown
            - 'all_days' or None: Total aggregation (single row, DEFAULT)
            
        campaign_ids: Optional list of campaign IDs to filter results.
            **HOW TO USE:** 
            1. Call list_campaigns() first to get campaign IDs
            2. Filter campaigns by name pattern you need
            3. Pass matching IDs here as a list: ["id1", "id2", "id3"]
            This filters at API level - much more efficient than client-side filtering!
            
        adset_ids: Optional list of ad set IDs to filter results.
            Same workflow as campaign_ids but for ad sets.
            
        ad_ids: Optional list of ad IDs to filter results.
            Same workflow as campaign_ids but for ads.
            
        flatten_actions: If True (default), flattens nested action arrays.
            - True: Returns action_purchase, action_lead as separate fields
            - False: Returns raw actions array (rarely needed)

    Returns:
        List of dictionaries, each containing the requested metrics.
        
        **EXAMPLE RESPONSE (level='campaign', time_increment='1'):**

            },
            ...

            level="campaign",
            time_increment="1"
        )
        
        **3. Get data for SPECIFIC campaigns only (by ID):**
        get_account_insights(
            account_id="act_123456789",
            start_date="2025-01-01",
            end_date="2025-01-31",
            fields=["campaign_name", "spend", "impressions"],
            level="campaign",
            campaign_ids=["123456789012345678", "234567890123456789"]
        )
        
        **4. Get conversion data with purchases and leads:**
        get_account_insights(
            account_id="act_123456789",

        )
        # Returns: action_purchase, action_lead, action_value_purchase, 
        #          conversion_schedule_total, etc.

    Note:
        - Pagination is handled automatically - you get ALL results
        - For large date ranges with daily breakdowns, expect many rows
